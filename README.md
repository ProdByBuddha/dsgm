# Digital Sustainable Growth Model (DSGM)

The **Digital Sustainable Growth Model (DSGM)** is a systems-level economic framework designed for a world in which **artificial intelligence becomes the dominant agent of value creation** and traditional human labor is no longer the primary driver of income, productivity, or growth.

At its core, DSGM addresses a looming structural failure in modern economies:  
most fiscal, legal, and social institutions assume that *humans earn wages*, *wages are taxed*, and *taxes fund public goods*. As automation and AI erode labor’s role, that assumption breaks—placing governments, markets, and social stability at risk.

DSGM proposes a new foundation.

Rather than centering economic rights and growth on employment, the model introduces mechanisms for:

- **Decoupling income from labor** without collapsing incentives or markets  
- **Redirecting AI-generated value** into sustainable public and human benefit  
- **Preserving human economic agency** in a post-labor environment  
- **Maintaining fiscal solvency** when machines, not people, produce the surplus  

The model reframes artificial intelligence not merely as a productivity tool, but as a **new class of economic actor** whose output must be governed, allocated, and reinvested with the same seriousness once reserved for labor and capital.

DSGM is intended for policymakers, economists, technologists, researchers, and institutions grappling with questions such as:

- What happens when employment is no longer the primary income mechanism?  
- How do societies fund public goods when labor tax bases erode?  
- How can AI-driven growth be made broadly sustainable rather than extractive?  
- What economic rights do humans retain in an AI-dominant economy?
